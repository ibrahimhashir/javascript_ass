        document.getElementById('dom2').innerHTML = "Hi, my name is Ibrahim Hahsir, I am PHP developer. \
        I have been at OiC for some months now, and have thoroughly enjoyed myself here. The school is great,\
         the people are fantastic and the atmosphere is one that makes you actually want to go to coding school.\
          Before I joined OIC I was studying at Vsoft School for more than 4 months. I was born and raised in Lagos \
          and grew up there <br> <br>I am an interesting, fun loving guy with a good sense of humor. One thing about me that\
           is important to know though is that at first I come of as a very shy individualistic guy but once I get to know\
            people\ and are comfortable with my environment I am great. It is hard for me to make friends but\
         once I make them, itâ€™s great and I am all different. I joke, laugh and humor people and I also get as much as I give. \
         I am a very kind, compassionate, sensitive guy as my close friends will tell you. I have a tough shell but on the inside I am soft. \
         I am also a very principled person and stand strong on what is right and wrong. I am also a very straight and honest person. I understand and know that we all put on a show\
          sometimes and do not show who we really are or what we feel but some people do this constantly and those kinds of people I cannot stand."
